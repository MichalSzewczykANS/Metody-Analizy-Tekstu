"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER - PHONE BROKEN AND THEY ARE IGNORING MY EMAILS AND NOT HONOURING THE WARRANTY   Item was good but has now malfunctioned on its own and seller is not honouring UK warranty despite claiming it is included in item listing.     Contacted the manufacturer who said the UK warranty should last 2 years but the phone was in fact purchased in Saudi Arabia (based on the IMEI number), so they cannot honour the warranty. I have been left £450 out of pocket and because this claim is being filed after 180 days I am not protected by Amazon.     I have been trying to contact the seller many times without response.

"In general, a very valid smartphone, aesthetically beautiful, very fast and responsive, a little immature in terms of software, and with some small youthful defects but comparable to the best-known top of the range, it does not lose out in comparison.The only big problem we encountered is that, unfortunately, as it seems, almost all Xiaomi products (and other manufacturers) have a big problem, which is now well known.WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype and email notifications do not arrive in real time, or arrive after a few minutes or even disappear after a few moments from the bar.Each time you have to open the various apps to see if a message has arrived.Tried various technical solutions and apps, and permissions, which seemed to solve the problem, but unfortunately no improvement.Then, all of a sudden, there are times, that notifications arrive normally...

"I bought this smartphone to replace my Samsung Galaxy S7 which was getting old, and frankly it's night and day (But that's normal given the number of years that separate them).Points +: - top screen - battery that lasts a day easily - fast charging with or wirelessly - processor speed (very smooth) - MUI interface (simple and full of interesting gadgets) - very good triple sensor camera Points -: - absence of 3.5 mm mini jack port (but an adapter is provided) - mono sound from the speakers (but the sound is clear and powerful) In short, this product is almost perfect.And if I had to buy it again I would do it with my eyes closed.P-S: If the drop on the top of the screen bothers you, know that the MI 9T pro has just been released.......",Xiaomi,Mi9,1.000,P,0.031,0.818,0.151,0.9586,P
"An iPhone user for years, I tried Android (a Sony Z) 4 years ago, but was not convinced.Today, given the abusive prices of Apple smartphones, I tried again.I chose Xiaomi because the system (MIUI overlay) seemed to be as close as possible to iOS (no application drawer)... In the end, after 2 months of use, I'm really not disappointed.I was able to configure the phone to look as close to what I had on iPhone as possible, with even customizable options added.Of course, the settings are sometimes a bit numerous and difficult to find at first, but once configured as you wish, the phone is perfect.I just regret 1 or 2 iOS apps not ported to Android but maybe that will come.For half the price of an iPhone (around €400), I have a responsive, powerful smartphone, with a beautiful calibrated and bright screen and 128 GB of storage.In addition, the apps, once opened, are identical on Android or iOS.The only small criticism that we could make of the Mi 9 is in terms of the camera in a poorly lit environment.this is THE concession made by Xiaomi compared to the iPhone or Samsung S flagships, but all the tests say so and I was therefore warned.What's more, during the day the photos are of good quality (It's a smartphone, not a SLR!).The battery life is quite decent without being exceptional, but the fast charger supplied with it is really effective and 1/2 hour of charging in the middle of the day is more than enough to last until the next day (for my moderate use in any case).In short, for the price, I am very satisfied with the Mi 9.

Great quality-price ratio, great minimalistic design, a marvellous camera -well, cameras, in plural-... It runs fast and smooth, has a great Operating System -the Xiaomi layer which I adore-...     I think it was a great buy and I guess it would be for those who don't want to spend almost a thousand dollars to have the latest in technology. When I bought it, it was the latest, but for a fraction of the cost of many other phones.     I would recommend it. The ocean blue is beautiful in itself… And, well, it does it's job: calls, messages, email and many apps contained in its 128 Gbs. I can't ask for more for less than 500 euros.",Xiaomi,Mi9,1.000,P,0.007,0.747,0.246,0.9944,P
"The phone itselft is really good he have a really good design MIUI is really easy to use the camera is also very good the amoled screen is good too the only thing that is missing in this phone is the dual speaker, the speaker he got is really powerfull but a dual speaker would be really apreciated for a more imersive experience, He also have widevine l1 so you can run all drm app without problem like netflix and amazon prime in 1080p.     But take care there is no headphone it the package and in the EU you have too but fortunatly amazon gave me a refund to buy some :) like always the amazon sav is here if you have any problem.",Xiaomi,Mi9,1.000,P,0.071,0.722,0.207,0.9539,P
"Purchase motivated by reading the specialized press and... comments from other Amazon customers!For a reasonable price, we have a device that offers the characteristics of a much more expensive iPhone or Samsung.The camera section presents a large number of options: - format (square, 3/4, 16/9, pano obviously, etc.) - retouching of the photo taken - possibility of taking 48 MP instead of 12 (even if the result is not obvious, and if the file is in fact larger) - etc.The autonomy seems particularly important (it seems to be linked to the smartphone's chip, which is more energy efficient, because the battery capacity is just about average).It looks very elegant in the blue version and it comes with a transparent soft shell for protection.Only small problem in my opinion: the optical unit protrudes quite a bit at the back, even with the protective shell in place.To console ourselves, we will say that all the brands have, unfortunately, started... We will see how it will age over time, after a few years in a bag or placed on a table... On the other hand, the block is well positioned - on the back, on the left - because there is little risk when you take a photo of putting your fingers on it!",Xiaomi,Mi9,1.000,P,0.043,0.858,0.099,0.9008,P

"I bought this smartphone some time ago.That's why I can report here from the perspective of a long-term user.I have been a loyal HTC customer since smartphones were invented.However, this proved to be very difficult since HTC no longer produces flagships.When looking for a new manufacturer apart from the big apple, Samsung and Huawei, I quickly came across Xiaomi.These have defeated all competitors due to price/performance.At first I thought, ""Well, a new Chinese manufacturer? Is that such a good idea?"" But I wasn't disappointed!The cell phone itself is incredibly fast thanks to the latest processor at the time.I haven't noticed any losses since then.All apps load very quickly.So far I haven't found an app that I couldn't use, which was usually the case with Chinese devices.The camera is really great.I got a lot of positive feedback from friends who initially thought I had the Huawei P30 Pro.Ultra wide angle/48mp option takes really great photos.The macro function also works perfectly.As a smartphone photographer, I can't imagine anything better.Slow motion function with 960 images also works without annoying flickering when there is enough light.In terms of software, the cell phone is also great for subsequent image editing!I also often took advantage of the video function at concerts.Unfortunately, only sound without bass is recorded here.I would like to record with bass.But maybe that's the case with the Mi10 😊.Battery life and fast charging function are a dream.When the cell phone is switched off, the cell phone fully charges in a very short time.All in all, a really great phone and a clear purchase recommendation",Xiaomi,Mi9,1.000,P,0.027,0.78,0.193,0.9953,P
